# PasswordPyProj

## Goal of this project
- Examined the top 200 most common password trends of 49 countries to help business owners and IT leaders make informed password related decisions. 

## What's in the folder?
- Password Time Over Years - CSV files of top 200 most common passwords and the time it would have taken to crack in years 2015 to 2020.

## Findings
- Of all the unique passwords on the list in 2020, I found that 84.3% of the passwords had a complexity of one. Which means that they contained only one character type such as being in all lower case or all uppercase. 
- The more complex a password is (has combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and 12+ length), the longer it takes to crack the password. 
- Over time, passwords are cracked faster due to technologies evolving over the years.
- Suggest to continuosly monitor the common password trends.
  - If you have found that over the past few years, the average length of the leaked passwords has been increasing, you might also consider increasing the minimum password length for your company since the trend may be an indicator that the technology we have today has gotten a lot better at cracking longer passwords.
